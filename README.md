# encrypted_traffic_classification

# introduction

Today, encrypted data serves as an important tool for maintaining user privacy and information security. 

However, the attackers exploited traffic encryption to transmit malware.

Therefore, we want to develop a model that classifies encrypted traffic that is performed quickly even given a new and unfamiliar dataset

# Selected Approach

We developed a machine that classifies traffic using a search problem.

We performed a process of feature extraction and selection of relevant features on the dataset

Finally we used Elasticsearch with AKNN, which  enables searching and locating similar documents or items in real time.
